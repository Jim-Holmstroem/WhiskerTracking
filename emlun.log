Worked on the database refactoring. Made unit tests for wdb.

(Log written 2012-04-03)
Worked on generation of bouncing squares.
Started working on splitting the database backend into groups of independent parameters.

Tweaked bouncing squares generator.
Started working on optimizing database queries and implementing the PF on the bouncing squares.

2012-03-26
Wrote a bit on the report together with Jim.
Generated falling, bouncing squares and ran the DB tracker on them. Horribly bad results and time performance.

(Log written 2012-03-26)
Improved some docstrings. Fiddled a bit with the square trackers. Talked with Jim a bit about the project in general.

2012-03-09
Continued work on the database:
- Improved generation of database in the square generator
- Added sampling functions to the database
- Implemented a square tracker that uses the database and tried some different parameter values
Eric Larsson stopped by to watch the tracker in action and offer some of his thoughts.

2012-03-01
Refactored the trivial PF implementation to save images to disk rather than show them on screen
Some other refactoring
Worked on state transition database

2012-02-29
Wrote function for creating SQLite database with tables, also worked on abstraction layer but didn't commit anything.
Monday meeting (yes, today is Wednesday): see protocol.

2012-02-23
Christropher informed us that he will switch to another project group. The reason was that the other group had received a project he had asked for.
Finished the trivial particle filter implementation. Can now track a moving, rotating square well enough.
Fixed some errors in wmath.distribution and wmedia.video.

2012-02-20
Monday meeting, see protocol.
Worked on the simple implementation of the particle filter.

2012-02-17
Tweaked plan a bit.
Discussed project plan and implementation details.
Wrote particle filter core functions.
Wrote weighted_choice function and some tests for it.

2012-02-16
Between 10:00 and 12:00: Read more about the particle filter, wrote down the algorithm to better understand it, tried to construct a simple tracking example. Helped Christopher with Ubuntu. Accepted Jim's proposed project plan.
Between 14:00 and 17:00: Finalized first draft of time plan with the other two. Discussed how the particle filter works. Discussed some implementation details.

2012-02-15
Between 10:00 and 12:00: Read about particle filter, instructed Christopher in the use of git, and read some more.
Between 15:00 and 17:00: Inspected a simple third party Python implementation of the particle filter, discussed the project a bit, read a lot more about the particle filter.

2012-02-13
Did complimentary assignment for missing lecture 2012-02-08 for ~4 hours.
Monday Meeting with Jim and Christopher for 2 hours (they started some 1.5 hours earlier). Goal of the week is to complete a particle filter implementation and some fabricated input data.
