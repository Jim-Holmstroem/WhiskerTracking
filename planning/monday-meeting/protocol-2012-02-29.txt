Protocol for Monday Meeting, Wednesday 2012-02-29

We realized our initial planning was a bit optimistic and therefore revised
it. Everything was pushed forward a week or two.

This week we will work on:
- Finishing the trivial implementation of the particle
filter
- Building framework for the state transition database
- Generating synthetic whisker videos

Primarily, Jim will work on the third and Emil will work on the first two with
Jim helping out.
