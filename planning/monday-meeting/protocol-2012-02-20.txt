Monday meeting 2012-02-20

Jim has retrieved report skeleton files from higher instances.
Jim has tweaked the plan a bit.
We recap'd particle filter concepts and such, and a broad overview of what the
project is about - what we intend to do and how.

This week:
- We plan to have a working particle filter implementation for tracking trivial
things by the middle of the week. A day or two is allocated for refactoring
it.
- We are to start building a state-transition database
- We are to generate a whisker video.


Reflections on the future:

What will we include in our state transistion databases? Different databases
for different states of the project? Will we use synthetic state transitions
for tracking real whiskers?

When evaluating different models, metrics and whatnot, we should include
hypotheses on their performance as well as conclusions in the report.

(Lots of?) Models in appendix!
