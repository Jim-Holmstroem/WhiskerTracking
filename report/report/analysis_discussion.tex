One must be carefull doing this type of experimental analysis on generate whiskers and then
applying the conclusions on real whiskers, but we could still use the best parameters
as a starting point for further studies on real whiskers.

However, much machine learning
research includes experimental studies in which algo-
rithms are compared using a set of data sets with little
or no consideration given to what class of applications
those data sets might represent. It is dangerous to draw
general conclusions about relative performance on any
application from relative performance on this sample
of some unknown class of applications. Such experi-
mental evaluation has become known disparagingly as
a bake-off .

the instance space that are not included in the training data." - Encyclopedia

Can a particlefilter overfit?(should this perhaps be in theory?)
