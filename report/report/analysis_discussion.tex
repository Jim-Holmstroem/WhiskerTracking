Care must be taken when doing this type of experimental analysis on generated whiskers, and then
applying the conclusions on real whiskers. 
To quote Encyclopedia of Machine Learning\cite{EncyclopediaMachineLearning} under the section ``Algorithm Evaluation''
\begin{quote}
    However, much machine learning
    research includes experimental studies in which algorithms 
    are compared using a set of data sets with little
    or no consideration given to what class of applications
    those data sets might represent. It is dangerous to draw
    general conclusions about relative performance on any
    application from relative performance on this sample
    of some unknown class of applications. Such experimental
    evaluation has become known disparagingly as a bake-off.
\end{quote}

But the results should still probably give some direction for the parameters for further studies on real whiskers.
