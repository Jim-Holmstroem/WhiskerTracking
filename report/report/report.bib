ABSTRACT = "We describe two systems for the real-time recording and display of individual vibrissa movements in head-fixed rats. Both systems utilize high-speed, linear image sensors, each composed of an array of light sensitive elements (CCDs). Uniform illumination of the array generates a constant baseline voltage in each element. The shadow produced by the movement of a whisker interposed between the light source and the sensors produces a voltage shift in a subset of elements. The successive position of the shift is linearly related to the momentary whisker position. Associated software/hardware scans the array at regular intervals to identify the successive positions of voltages above a preset threshold and outputs the data to a microprocessor for computation of the whisker movement trajectory. In both systems, movements of a single whisker may be monitored ‘on-line’ with high spatial and temporal resolution; in one case with, in the other without the presence of neighboring whiskers. Optoelectronic monitoring facilitates rapid and efficient (computer-assisted) acquisition and analysis of data on rodent whisking behavior."

ABSTRACT = "Understanding how whisker-based tactile information is represented in the nervous system requires quantification of sensory input and observation of neural activity during whisking and whisker touch. Chronic electrophysiological methods have long been available to study neural responses in awake and behaving animals; however, methods to quantify the sensory input on whiskers have not yet been developed. Here we describe an unsupervised algorithm to track whisker movements in high-speed video recordings and to quantify the statistics of the tactile information on whiskers in freely behaving animals during haptic object exploration. The algorithm does not require human identification of whiskers, nor does it assume the shape, location, orientation, length of whiskers, or direction of the whisker movements. The algorithm performs well on temporary loss of whisker visibility and under low-light/low-contrast conditions even with inherent anisotropic noise and non-Gaussian variability in the signal. Using this algorithm, we define the speed [protraction (P), 1,081 ± 322; retraction (R), 1,564 ± 549 °/s], duration (P, 34 ± 10; R, 24 ± 8 ms), amplitude (P = R, 40 ± 13°), and frequency (19 ± 7 Hz) of active whisking in freely behaving mice. We furthermore quantify whisker deflection induced changes in whisking kinematics and calculate the statistics (i.e., speed, amplitude and duration) of whisker touch and finally show that whisker deprivation does not alter whisking kinematics during haptic exploration."

ABSTRACT = "The mystacial vibrissae or whiskers in rodents are sensitive tactile hairs emerging from both sides of the face. Rats and mice actively move these whiskers during exploration. The neuronal mechanisms controlling whisker movements and the sensory representation of whisker tactile information are widely studied as a model for sensorimotor processing in mammals. Studies of the natural whisker movement patterns during exploration and tactile examination are still in their early stages. Tracking the movements of whiskers is technically challenging as they move relatively fast and are very thin, particularly in mice. Existing systems detect light-beam interruptions by the whiskers or use high-speed video to track whisker movements in one or two dimensions. Here we describe a method for tracking the movements of mouse whiskers in 3 dimensions (3D) using using optical motion capture technology. Optical motion capture technology tracks the movements of small retro-reflective markers attached to whiskers of a head-fixed mouse with a spatial resolution of &lt;0.5mm in all three dimensions and a temporal resolution of 5msec (200 fps). The system stores the 3D coordinates of the marker?s trajectories onto hard disk allowing a detailed analysis of movement trajectories bilateral coordination."
