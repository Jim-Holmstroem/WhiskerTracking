With the ever increasing power and mobility of computers, computer
vision has recently seen a large increase in interest.  Encompassing
problems such as classification, recognition, perception and tracking,
application of the discipline could make many tasks easier and more
efficient.

In particular, biology and neuroscience researchers are interested in
tracking the movements and posture \cite{WhiskerVideography} of
animals or parts of animals.  One such field aims to study the
movements of rodent whiskers. However, most whisker tracking software
available today suffers a few fundamental flaws.  They are either so
expensive that not even well funded laboratories feel they can afford
them or have problems tracking multiple whiskers at once, often
requiring removal of almost all whiskers.  Some higher precision
systems impose other restrictions on the experiment, such as
restraining the animal or attaching motion capture markers to the
whiskers. The latter does not seem to be a significant problem
\cite{BadExample1}, but keeping the animal restrained eliminates the
possibility of studying whisker use in exploration.

\section{Difficulties}
In general, the main difficulty in tracking and localization is to
separate the tracked object from clutter and occlusion. In 2001,
Hedvig Sidenbladh investigated probabilistic methods for tracking
three-dimensional human motion in monocular video. \cite{Hedvig} Many
of the problems inherent in computer vision were regarded, and the
thesis shows that powerful conclusions can be drawn by combining
multiple visual cues.\footnote{The solution in this thesis employs
  only a single visual cue.}

The most apparent problems in whisker tracking is occlusion and motion
blur. Other, more subtle, problems include 3D to 2D projection
ambiguities and that the whisker root is constantly occluded by facial
hairs. The latter gives us the problem of not knowing where the
whiskers are rooted, making the whiskers more difficult to model. The
relatively low spatial and temporal resolution in highspeed video may
also result in subpixel whiskers and motion
blur.\cite{WhiskerVideography}



\section{Contributions of this thesis}
This thesis provides three main contributions:
\begin{description}
\item[Functional model] Use of functions as the model, and the $\Lp$
  norm to better represent "distance" between two hypotheses, for the
  prediction part of the particle filter.
\item[Proof of concept] An example implementation showing that
  probabilistic whisker tracking is indeed feasible.
\item[Parameter investigation] Parameter analysis on the algorithm and
  how the tracking parameters affect the quality of tracking.
\end{description}

This mainly addresses the problem of occlusion. Using a model makes
the tracking more robust against crossing whiskers, as opposed to pure
frame-by-frame image analysis where this is often a great
problem. Similiarly, the problem of overlapping whiskers becomes less
apparent, but is still an issue.
