The code has a main focus on being modular since we are only doing a proof-of-concept implementation and additionally does not have any issues with not being real-time.
The implementation is all centered around the particle filter handling the filtering.

\section{The particle filter}
    A plug-n-play algorithm which only lacks the problem-domain<ref:encyc> specific parts:$x_0$, $\cprob{x_t}{x_{t-1}}$ and $\cprob{I_t}{x_t}$
    \subsection{Initilization $x_0$}
        The particle filter only does tracking thus we need to have an initial guess for $t=0$ which in our case will be hand labeled foreach whisker.
    \subsection{Goodness $\kappa\cprob{x_t}{I_t}$}
        It also needs an direction to know how good the hypothesis $x_t$ matches the given image $I_t$.

        TODO <ref:theorem>
    \subsection{Sampling $\cprobnext{x}$}

        ...

\section{The state transition database}





\section{Real data}
    \subsection{Pre-processing}

    We want to find the function $\prob{I=\text{whisker}}$

    >We want to have a measure on how probable it is for a pixel to hosehould a whisker
