The bake-off <ref> setup:

Evaluated parameters:
    p     - for the norm
    a     - penelty for the norm
    N     - number of transitions
    cp    - particle count
    sigma - on resample blur

will be tested on a small set of benchmarks consisting of 4 disperse(d?)/scatter generated whisker videos.

The test matrix:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{p,a,N,...}(benchmark)
\end{equation}

The measures we will use as fitness of the algorithm is:
    integrating over time the the difference with the ground truth (do this for L{1:10} and see if it correlates with the p choosed
    integrating over time the response for the choosed hypotethis (to see how the image transformation affects the results)
    4 image samples (checked by hand, subjective)

"A learning algorithm must interpolate appropriate predictions for regions of
the instance space that are not included in the training data." - Encyclopedia

<<graph over the setup>>

The fitness test was runned on different machines but this wont effect the
result since we initially wont consider the running time.

The runtime for the algorithm is handled separately on one machine setup <...>

"
However, much machine learning
research includes experimental studies in which algo-
rithms are compared using a set of data sets with little
or no consideration given to what class of applications
those data sets might represent. It is dangerous to draw
general conclusions about relative performance on any
application from relative performance on this sample
of some unknown class of applications. Such experi-
mental evaluation has become known disparagingly as
a bake-off .
