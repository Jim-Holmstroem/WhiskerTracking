<choose the word:(performance vs fitness)>

The bake-off <ref> setup for the experimental parameter evalution<ref>:

Evaluated parameters:
    p     - for the norm
    a     - penelty for the norm
    N     - number of transitions
    cp    - particle count
    sigma - on resample blur

will be tested on a small set of benchmarks consisting of 4 disperse(d?)/scatter generated whisker videos.

The test matrix:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{p,a,N,...}(benchmark)
\end{equation}

The measures we will use as fitness of the algorithm is:
    integrating over time the the difference with the ground truth (do this for L{1:10} and see if it correlates with the p choosed
    integrating over time the response for the choosed hypotethis (to see how the different image transformation affects the results)
    4 image samples foreach video (checked by hand, subjective)

<<graph over the setup>>

The fitness test was runned on different machines but this wont effect the
result since we initially wont consider the running time.

The runtime for the algorithm is handled separately on one machine setup <...>
