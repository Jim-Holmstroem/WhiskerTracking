[Tracking Methods:]
Among many different approaches to tracking, the most widely used ones are:

[TODO, is this both localization and tracking enlisted?]

= Blob tracking

= Contour tracking
== Recursive bayesian estimator [is this the correct term?]
=== Particle filter

Particle filter: useful for sampling the underlying state-space distribution of nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes."

Monte carlo method

{ASSUMPTIONS:}
{PROS: Can deal with multinomial data}
{CONS:}
{WURTH NOTING: there are many variants of particle filters; we are only considering the most basic one. }

=== Kalman filter
[TODO, what function is linear in this case ?]
"Kalman filter: an optimal recursive Bayesian filter for linear functions subjected to Gaussian noise" -Wiki
{ASSUMPTIONS: normal-distrubuted data, linear functions}
{PROS: [faster?]}
{CONS: cant deal with multinomal dists.}

= Visual feature  matching 

= Kernel-based tracking


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
under tracking methods
Seperate into: localization and tracking 
tracking(localization) , that is the tracking algorithm still needs a localization algorithm to get some kind of measure
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
