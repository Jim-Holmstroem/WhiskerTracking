The interest in studying rodent whiskers has recently seen a significant increase, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. As a result, there is a need for automatic extraction of movement data from video sequences. Currently available commercial solutions either are extremely expensive, place great restrictions on the experiment, or break down when whiskers cross or overlap.

This thesis proposes a probabilistic solution to the tracking problem. The main difference from currently available ones is that this solution internally maintains a parameterized model of each tracked whisker, and can therefore track multiple whiskers at once with little problems. While more computationally expensive, this enables more reliable tracking without placing restrictions on the experiment.
