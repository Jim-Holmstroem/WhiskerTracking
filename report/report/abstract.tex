The interest in studying rodent whiskers has recently seen a
significant increase, particularly in the field of neurophysiology. As
a result, there is a need for automatic tracking of whisker
movements. Currently available commercial solutions either are
extremely expensive, restrict the experiment setup, or fail in the
presence of \emph{clutter} or occlusion.

This thesis proposes a proof-of-concept implementation of a
\emph{probabilistic} tracking system.  This solution uses a technique
known as the \emph{particle filter} to propagate a whisker model
between frames of high speed video.  In each frame, the next state of
the model is predicted by querying a pre-trained \emph{database} and
filtering the results through the particle filter. The implementation
is written in Python 2.6 using NumPy and SQLite3.

Testing results indicate that the approach is feasible. Even using a
rather crude database, the tracker manages to track multiple real
whiskers at once, though only for short sequences at a time. Better
training data, such as hand-labeled real data, might vastly improve
the result.
