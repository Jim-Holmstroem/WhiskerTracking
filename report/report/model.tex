Let the $whisker$ function be defined as a function that takes a $\omega\in\RP$
and returns a position $whisker(\omega)\in\RR^2$.

The idea is to find a function $whisker^*$ that approximates the $whisker$.

The class of functions that are available for consideration:

It must be able to sufficiently approximate the whisker
\begin{equation}
    \forall whisker \exists whisker^* : whisker \approx whisker^*
\end{equation}
that is, it must be able to fill the range/image for the $whisker$ function.
As an example a straight line will not suffice since the $whisker$ is generally
curved.

Additionally it must of course be $C_1$ and have finitely many parameters.

We might also assume that a whisker has one fix point at the origin, which we choose, the boundary 
condition appears
\begin{equation}
    whisker^*(0)=\bar{0}
\end{equation}
this is not the case in the real data, 
generally we have time dependacy
\begin{equation}
    whisker(0,t)\neq\bar{0} 
\end{equation}
since rodents probably can move around their whisker base on the chin surface.

We are for all cases assuming that the whisker thickness is defined by

\begin{equation}
    d(\omega) = \begin{cases}
        D \omega=0\\
        D-\frac{D\omega}{L} \omega<L\\
        0 \omega\ge L
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}


where $D,L>0$


\subsubsection{$\Spline$}

Our first and simplest candidate is the 3rd degree polynom

This chose can be justified by the theory of beams under small curvature(?) in the area of 
strength of materials, after all a whisker is not to far away from a beamer.<ref>



It is hard to analytically justify the chose of $whisker^*$ since we do not
have an analytic model for the $whisker$.
