        It works well under temporary occlusion but needs clipping of most whiskers and thereby introduce possible effects to the experimental results.



    \subsection{High-Precision, Three-Dimensional Tracking of Mouse Whisker Movements with Optical Motion Capture Technology\cite{BadExample1}}
        


        Uses a 3D tracking system consisting of two high-speed cameras and markers mounted on the whiskers of the head-fixed mouse.
        The head-fixed is for the markers must be visible at all times to make the tracking work.
