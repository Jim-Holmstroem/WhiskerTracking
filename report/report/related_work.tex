The following is a summary of some of the work that has been done in
the field of automatic whisker tracking, as well as a Ph.D thesis on
probabilistic tracking of human motion. The work in this thesis will
be based on the latter, being a similiar - though a lot simpler -
solution applied to the case of whisker tracking.


\subsection{High-Precision, Three-Dimensional Tracking of Mouse
  Whisker Movements with Optical Motion Capture Technology}

\cite{BadExample1} describes a whisker tracking system that uses
motion capture markers and two tracking cameras to track whisker
movements in 3D. A spatial resolution of $<0.5$ mm in all dimensions
and a temporal resolution of $5 ms$ is reported. The impact of the
markers on whisker movements were investigated by comparison with a
light beam detection system, and no significant difference was
detected. The system requires head fixation since the markers need to
be visible to both cameras at all times.
        

\section{Unsupervised Whisker Tracking in Unrestrained Behaving
  Animals}

\cite{UnsupervisedTracking} provides a solution that

It works well under temporary occlusion but needs clipping of most
whiskers and thereby introduce possible effects to the experimental
results.
