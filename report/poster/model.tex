A simple parametric model $ax^3+bx^2+cx$ is in main focus for its simplicty but other models will be evaluated

<figure of examples of "rendering" of the model with different parameters>

how is the position and 

analytical Lp of 
where do we use Lp?




subsection $P(update|update-1)$


subsection $P(\tilde{I_t)|\bar{\Theta_t})$
    represents the probability that the given model $\Theta_t$ is the current one in the image
    [is the probability turned around?]
    
    but since we dont have this we need to estimate this some how and one way to
    do this is by trying to render the object given the parameter $\Theta_t$
