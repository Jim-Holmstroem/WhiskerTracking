Classify our algorithm (lazy/eager) see bik12

rename goodness to "closeness" since its more widely used in ML

Minkowski metric - L_p norm (L_1(more resistant to noise) and L_inf(noisy))
Our distance functions must be metric, prove this for all.

Feature selection: (100D noise,1D disc. information) - with unweighted euclidian distance the 100D will always dominate \sum(x_i-mu_i)^2
solution: We want large variation in the class labels to be more significant (for example, PCA assumes label variation is proportional to variation, which is some times generally true)

test different combinations of algorithms fitnesses=lambda (func1,func2,...) :[(func1,func2,..),fitness(func1,func2,...)], prod(FuncSpace1,FuncSpace2,...)
best = max(fitnesses)
where fitness is how well the algorithm performes on validatiot-data


bayes optimal as in bik12, is this applicable ?
